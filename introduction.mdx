## Overview

Hivemind's Open Source software enables developers to easily develop their TeamCode and create more advanced autonomous and tele-op applications. It allows for seamless integration with microservices like Grafana and Tailscale.

For First Tech Challenge teams, especially beginners, the Hivemind documentation provides an in-depth understanding of the key aspects that make a team of developers interested in infrastructure and self-hostable seamless integration with services like GitHub and Docker. We offer the necessary resources and information to effortlessly integrate with CI/CD for FTC.
