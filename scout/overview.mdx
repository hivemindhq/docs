## Use-cases

- **Ease of access**, Scout makes it easy to access everyone's metrics in one spot, mixing it with <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/">AlertManager</a> or <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/">Grafana Alerts</a> could allow you to get live-updates over SMS or Discord of which team is currently the best pick.
- **Know what your alliance is capable of**, it's always nice to know what your alliance partners are able to do before the matches even start.
