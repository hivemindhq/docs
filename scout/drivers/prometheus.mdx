Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. This is the recommended metric driver and is perfect for integrated environments like Kubernetes and Docker.

## Installing Prometheus

Prometheus can be installed in multiple ways, depending on your environment. You may also install Prometheus directly on your machine. Alternatively, <a href="https://docs.victoriametrics.com/">VictoriaMetrics</a> can be used as a drop-in alternative for Prometheus.

<Accordion title="Docker Compose">
**Pros:**

- Declarative configuration
- Integrates well with existing infrastructure components

**Cons:**

- Can be confusing for beginners

First, install the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> command to your server. Then create a compose file somewhere, like `~/.deployment/scout/docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml

version: "3"

services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    restart: always
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
      - data-prometheus:/prometheus
    networks:
      - prometheus

networks:
  prometheus:
    external: true

# Remove this section if remote_write is used
volumes:
  data-prometheus:
```

<Accordion title="Pterodactyl">

**Pros:**

- Easy to set up
- Integrates well with existing infrastructure components

**Cons:**

- Some shared hosts may not support it

First, start by importing the <a href="https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/monitoring/prometheus">Prometheus Egg</a> to your panel, then create a new server with this egg.

Finally, start and stop the server. We'll need to configure it first.

<Warning>
The Prometheus egg has web interface enabled by default. This may pose security risks if not configured properly.

  This is not reccomended, but there are good guides out there on how to do it.

## Configuration

There are multiple configurations possible for Prometheus. Some configurations may fit your environment better than others. Please read the comments on the configuration file.

These will mostly be the same for all distribution methods, however the example below is for **Docker Compose**.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
# prometheus.yml

global:
  scrape_interval: 5s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "scout-1"
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          ["https://<your_hop_gateway>/query/<year>/<ftc_scout_competition_id>"]
```

<Info>
  Put this `prometheus.yml` inside the same folder as your `docker-compose.yml`
  file
